    <p>The DOM, the Document Object Model is an essential part in making websites interactive. It is the interface that will allow a programming language to manipulate the content, structure and style of a website. JavaScript is the language we will use client-side that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.</p>
    <p>Almost any time a website performs an action, such as rotating between a slideshow of images, displaying an error when a user attempts to submit an incomplete form, or toggling a navigation menu, it is the result of JavaScript accessing and manipulating the DOM. In this lesson, we will learn what the DOM is, how to work with the document object, and the difference between HTML source code and the DOM.</p>
    <p>At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. The browser that you use to view the website is a program that interprets HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page that you see.</p>
    <p>In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.</p>
